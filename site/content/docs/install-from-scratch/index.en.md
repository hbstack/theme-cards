### Replace Module Path

The module path is the identifier of your site, which typically is your repo URL, take `github.com/user/repo` as an example, you'll need to replace the `module github.com/hbstack/theme-cards/exampleSite` with `module github.com/user/repo`.

```sh
sed -i '1s/.*/module github.com\/user\/repo/' go.mod
```

### Delete the `replace` Directive

To build the site successfully, you'll need to delete the internal used `replace` directive: `replace github.com/hbstack/theme-cards => ../`.

```sh
sed -i '/^replace/d' go.mod
```

## Install Dependencies

```sh
npm ci
```

## Hugo Module Proxy (Optional)

A [Hugo module proxy](https://hugomods.com/blog/2023/04/go-and-hugo-proxy-servers/) is required when the default proxy isn't accessible from your location, i.e. China.

## Preview Locally

npm run dev
```
