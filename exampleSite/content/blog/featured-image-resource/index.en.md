To use page image resources as featured images, you'll need to put the image in page's folder, and naming it in `*feature*`, `*cover*` or `*thumbnail*` patterns, for example.

```sh
$ tree content/blog/featured-image-resource 
content/blog/featured-image-resource
├── featured.jpeg
├── index.en.md
└── index.zh-hans.md
```
